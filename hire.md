## What I offer:

*	**Front-end background** - Since you are already looking in my blog you can see that I (obviously) like Angular, but I’m open to use other technologies depending of the project.
*	**Back-end experience** - I mostly use node.js whenever I need to write some server-side code. You can have a look at my [npm modules](https://www.npmjs.com/~lilia.simeonova). 
*	**AI** - most of all I’m really passionate to be involved in the process of improving the user experience with AI and Machine learning.

## What I believe in:

* Proactivity
* Innovation
*	Self-development

## What I don’t believe in:

*	Stereotypes
*	Refusing to adjust
*	People who are always late - this one drives me crazy :)

If you think we are going to be a good fit, I will be happy to hear from you.
